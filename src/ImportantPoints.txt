-->	Async and Defer https://www.thatjsdude.com/images/asyncVsDefer.jpg -->avoid async,use defer to understand check image.
 	<script href=”index.js” async>  
	<script href=”index.js” defer>
 Note:- you should load script at the end so use defer instead on async.

-->In case of jquery:- why we use async for jquery libraries ,means loading this at the starting?
Answer:- actualy its not async ,we load jquery library first then load all the code after that.
