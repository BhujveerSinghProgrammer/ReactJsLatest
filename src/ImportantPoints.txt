-->	Async and Defer https://www.thatjsdude.com/images/asyncVsDefer.jpg -->avoid async,use defer to understand check image.
 	<script href=”index.js” async>  
	<script href=”index.js” defer>
 Note:- you should load script at the end so use defer instead on async.

-->In case of jquery:- why we use async for jquery libraries ,means loading this at the starting?
Answer:- actualy its not async ,we load jquery library first then load all the code after that.

//************Important*************
-->Dont use !important,its not good practice.

-->Div is called Block level element,it has width and height.
-->Inline elements :- does not take width and height like <span></span>,<h1> etc.
usually if we take 2 div's then it shows first div then down to it it shows second div,

-->but if we take inline element like <span> it comes/shows in inline,
and if we want 2 div in inline then we can take 2 <span>(or empty span) and set property like given below:-

display: inline-block; // this will make it block(div) and also be available in one inline.
