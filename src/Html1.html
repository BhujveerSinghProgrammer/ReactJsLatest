    But you should use sematically correct HTML
    1)SEO purpose (GoogleBOT or web crawlers):- For most sites, Googlebot shouldn't access your site more than once every few seconds on average. However, due to delays it's possible that the rate will appear to be slightly higher over short periods.
    Googlebot was designed to be run simultaneously by thousands of machines to improve performance and scale as the web grows. 

    2)Developer Efficiancy
    3)Assessiblity

<!-- HTML 5 Introduces:-
1.<Header>
2.<footer>
3.<main>
4.<aside>
5.<article>
6.<section>
7.<nav>

but before that we built whole web site by using <div> tag only.
Note:- <section> have <articles> and <articles> have paragraphs <p>.
Note:- <aside> is used for adds on the site,<aside> can also have sections.
Note:- Home page of any website or Login Page of the website build in Next Js or in HTML for SEO Purpose,but
      after login or dashboard etc that can be build on ReactJs. becoz with ReactJs SEO will not work .
