// document.appendChild(a);

// react says that I need one root element
// I will manipulate all the dom
// I will create all the html elements and append it to the html

// react is a generic library which will be used in order to create components and create html
// react dom is what would be used for your interaction of react with the DOM
// react native
// react native interact with your mobile app,instead of   "react-dom": "^18.0.0" use react native for mobile applications and also for web applications.
